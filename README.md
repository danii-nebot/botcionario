# botcionario

Just a fun chatbot built on the [MS Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) and [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai).

Definitions are (for the time being at least) shamelessly scraped from the Spanish version of [wiktionary.org](https://es.wiktionary.org)

Code based on the amazing [SitePoint's MS Bots course](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/ms-bots-2939)

## TODO:

- ~~Load up test list of most common words~~
- ~~VPTree package~~
- "Autocorrect" words before searching in wiktionary
- Add final list of most common spanish words
